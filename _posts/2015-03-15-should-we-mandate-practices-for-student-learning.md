title: Should we mandate instruction practices that are known to improve student learning?
categories: education, neuroscience

This is a summary of a discussion I led through a discussion group. This group is called the "STEM Education & Diversity Discussion Group" and it is organized by students and post-docs at UCSD/Salk Institute/Scripps.

**The subject of discussion was about the implementation of well-studied, if not always well-known, educational practices that can facilitate long-term retention of material.**

The main source material was a document produced by the Institute of Educational Sciences (IES), called [Organizing Instruction and Study to Improve Student Learning.](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/1)

This document also has some home relevance as [Hal Pashler](http://www.psychology.ucsd.edu/people/profiles/hpashler.html), a UCSD psychologist, spearheaded the efforts of producing this guide. In addition, my personal interest lies close to the interests of the STEM discussion group, but it specifically relates to the translation of research findings from neuroscience and psychology towards education. The document covers some of these findings that have been around for a while (it was written in 2007).
