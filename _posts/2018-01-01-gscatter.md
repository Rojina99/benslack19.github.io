I miss R's ggplot2. Like a lot.

I'm learning Python more and more but I don't think Python data visualizations are as easy as Hadley Wickham's R package. Don't get me wrong. Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Yhat's ggplot have great features. However, it's not always easy to figure out how to communicate the full meaning of a plot.

For example, a full-featured scatter plot would take advantage of marker size and marker color options. While displaying marker size and marker color is not difficult, placing a legend for interpretation of both is not as simple as when using ggplot2 in R. (For those wondering why the heck I didn't just use Yhat's ggplot, there were two reasons. One somewhat embarrassing reason was that I initially struggled to install ggplot with pip. Fortunately, I was able to overcome this when I found this very useful and recent post. Second, as I was testing my scatter plot function, I found one case where the Python ggplot function showed a bug. I'll show this down below.)

Therefore, I wrote my own scatter plot function using matplotlib underneath the hood. For data, I'm using a variant of a complex data frame that I described in another post. The data frame for the visualizations shown uses 30 samples for easy verification. Here are the first 10 rows for reference. The feature names represent the kind of distribution that the values take.
