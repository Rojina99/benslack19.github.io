I have long been interested in education and how people learn. This lead me to studying and researching neuroscience with a focus on brain plasticity. One example of this plasticity is shown in this image--new neurons generated during adulthood. Neuroscience research provided a natural introduction to coding and data science. The color coding in this image is the result of a script that I wrote. The script takes an image series and represents deeper layers with cool colors and superficial layers representing warm colors.
