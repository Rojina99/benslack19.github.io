I'm a biotech applications scientist, neuroscientist, part-time educator, wanna-be data scientist, and full-time consumer of Mexican food.

I received my bachelor's in biochemistry from UCLA, my master's and doctorate in neuroscience from Yale, and performed postdoctoral research at the Salk Institute. When I'm not working at my real job, I'm either watching Netflix, surfing, hiking, or eating at a well-reviewed restaurant with my wife somewhere in California.
