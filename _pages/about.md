This image encapsulates my interests of education, neuroscience, and data science. I have long been interested in education and how people learn. This lead me to studying and researching neuroscience, where I learned about different examples of brain plasticity. The example shown in the image are neurons born in adulthood. Human adult neurogenesis occurs in the dentate gyrus, a region important for learning and memory. The idea of brain plasticity and growth mindset is fundamental to effective learning, aligning with my interests in education.

My graduate school and postdoctoral neuroscience research provided a natural introduction to data science. In one data science project, I was interested in depicting a series of images in a single representation. The code I wrote for that project was used to produce this image. The cells are color-coded by depth, with deeper layers representing cool colors and superficial layers representing warm colors.

The image series was kindly provided by Chunmei Zhao, a fellow postdoctoral associate at the time.
