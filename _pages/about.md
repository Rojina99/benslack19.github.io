I'm a biotech applications scientist, neuroscientist, part-time educator, wanna-be data scientist, and full-time consumer of Mexican food.

I studied biochemistry at UCLA before earning my doctorate in neuroscience at Yale. I then performed postdoctoral research at the Salk Institute before I turned into an adult. I can be found coding, surfing (aka trying not to drown), or eating at a Yelp-reviewed restaurant with my wife somewhere in California.
