I'm a biotech applications scientist, neuroscientist, data scientist, and part-time educator.

Education can be a driver for societal change, so the factors underlying how people learn and how education potentiates that learning intrigue me. My entry into the learning field was through neuroscience research. Stimulated by my college biology courses, I investigated neural plasticity, including mechanisms of neurogenesis during graduate school at Yale University. In my postdoctoral research at the Salk Institute, I revealed the molecular changes that occur within neurons in response to an organism having new experiences. In parallel to my postdoc work, I served as a consultant to educators interested in knowing more about the brain. A list of my academic publications can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wGG8V78AAAAJ&hl=en). 

My academic experiences led me to a life science industry position which blends my interests in research and teaching. As an applications scientist in the Education and Applications Development group, I have a multi-faceted role that includes internal and commercial education, product support, serving as a technical liaison for Marketing, and performing data analysis.

I have extensive experience performing independent research, analyzing and interpreting complex data sets, optimizing data analysis protocols and communicating my results through oral and written presentations.

In my spare time, I can be found surfing (or trying to), hiking, or eating at a well-reviewed restaurant with my wife somewhere in California.
