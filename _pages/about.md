I'm a biotech applications scientist, neuroscientist, some-time data scientist, part-time educator, and full-time consumer of Mexican food.

I studied biochemistry at UCLA before earning my doctorate in neuroscience at Yale. I then performed postdoctoral research at the Salk Institute, before I turned into an adult. A list of my academic publications can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wGG8V78AAAAJ&hl=en).

I can be found coding, surfing (or trying to), or eating at a well-reviewed restaurant with my wife somewhere in California.
