I'm a biotech applications scientist, neuroscientist, some-time data scientist, part-time educator, and full-time consumer of Mexican food.

I studied biochemistry at UCLA before earning my doctorate in neuroscience at Yale. I then performed postdoctoral neuroscience research at the Salk Institute. My neuroscience interests have revolved around neural plasticity, including the mechanisms of neurogenesis and revealing the molecular changes that occur with neuronal activity. A list of my academic publications can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wGG8V78AAAAJ&hl=en). In parallel to my academic work, I served as a consultant to educators interested in knowing more about the brain. Currently, I work in industry where I support applications on single-cell sequencing and high-throughput genomics.

In my spare time, I can be found coding, surfing (or trying to), hiking, or eating at a well-reviewed restaurant with my wife somewhere in California.
