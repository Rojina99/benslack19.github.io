I'm a biotech applications scientist, neuroscientist, data scientist, part-time educator, and full-time consumer of Mexican food.

I studied biochemistry at UCLA before earning my doctorate in neuroscience at Yale. I then performed postdoctoral neuroscience research at the Salk Institute. My research was fueled by my interests in learning. I studied neural plasticity, including the mechanisms of neurogenesis and the molecular changes that occur with neuronal activity. In parallel to my academic work, I served as a consultant to educators interested in knowing more about the brain. A list of my academic publications can be found [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wGG8V78AAAAJ&hl=en). 

Currently, I work in the biotech industry where I work on projects involving single-cell sequencing and high-throughput genomics. My responsibilities include internal and commercial education, product support, and bioinformatics for development or customer datasets.

In my spare time, I can be found surfing (or trying to), hiking, or eating at a well-reviewed restaurant with my wife somewhere in California.
