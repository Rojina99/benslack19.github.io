Data engineering

"Know a little bit of data engineering to understand the process and understand what the other roles are doing. Be able to take incoming event data (likes, comments, etc.) and analyze metrics coming in each minute. MapReduce (Hadoop) runs programs on ~1000 machines at once. Hive is SQL for big datasets."



Big data engineering (Coursera) (average review of 4, although not great marks for how it was taught)
Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce (Udacity) (average review of 3.9 from Class Central)
