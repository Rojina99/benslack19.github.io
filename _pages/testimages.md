This is how to put in images.

See minimal mistakes [site](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/markup/markup-image-alignment/) about image formatting. But doesn't describe how to put images in different ways.




Inserting image by Markdown
![surfing-b&w](/assets/surfingBW.png){:height="525px" width="300px"}

Looks like you need some html anyway see [this link](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp) as a reference for formatting.

Using html code for centering and sizing (525 x 300) [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12090472/github-readme-md-center-image) and [this](https://github.com/waldyr/Sublime-Installer/edit/master/README.md) to center image

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/surfingBW.png" alt="surfingBW" style="width:600px;height:300px;"/>
</p>
